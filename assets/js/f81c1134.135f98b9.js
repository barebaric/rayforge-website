What started as a single\\ncommit on February 1st, 2025, has grown into a fully-featured laser\\ncutting and engraving platform.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Journey So Far\\n\\nOver the past year, Rayforge has evolved from a basic laser control tool\\ninto a comprehensive design and manufacturing platform. We\'ve built\\neverything from scratch: a parametric 2D CAD system, 3D G-code preview,\\nmulti-layer support, multi-laser support, camera alignment, work\\ncoordinate systems, and so much more.\\n\\nThis release represents the culmination of that vision - a stable,\\nproduction-ready tool that can handle real-world laser cutting and\\nengraving workflows.\\n\\n## What\'s New in 1.0\\n\\n### Project Save/Load\\n\\nThe most requested feature is finally here. You can now save your\\ncomplete workflows and restore them later. The `.ryp` (project) and\\n`.rfs` (sketch) file extensions are registered system-wide, so you can\\ndouble-click your projects to open them directly. A recent files menu\\nprovides quick access to your work.\\n\\n### Parametric Sketcher with Text Support\\n\\nThe sketcher now supports text with full constraint integration. Add\\ntext to your sketches, apply aspect ratio constraints, and control\\nplacement and sizing parametrically. This opens up a whole new world of\\ndesign possibilities for laser-engraved signs, labels, and decorative\\nelements.\\n\\n### Unified Bottom Panel\\n\\nThe jog dialog and log view have been merged into a single, unified\\nbottom panel. This consolidation provides a cleaner workspace while\\nkeeping essential machine control and monitoring tools readily\\naccessible. The panel features tabbed access to jog controls and log\\noutput, making it easy to switch between operations without losing\\nscreen real estate.\\n\\n### Other Improvements\\n\\n- **Bottom panel**: Jog dialog and log view are now merged into a\\n  unified bottom panel\\n- **Import dialog**: Errors are now collected and displayed together\\n- **Importers**: Almost completely rewritten for better testability\\n- **Sketcher stability**: Solver now biases points for more stable\\n  dragging\\n- **Bug fixes**: Multi-layer DXF import, alignment bugs, centering\\n  issues, and more\\n\\n## Feature Highlights\\n\\nRayforge 1.0 includes over 60 features:\\n\\n**Design Tools**\\n\\n- 2D CAD with parametric sketching\\n- Geometric and dimensional constraints\\n- Text support in sketches\\n- Multi-layer support\\n\\n**Manufacturing**\\n\\n- 2.5D operations (contour, raster, depth engraving)\\n- Multi-laser support\\n- Work Coordinate Systems (G54-G59)\\n- Path optimization and smoothing\\n- Holding tabs with auto-placement\\n\\n**Import/Export**\\n\\n- SVG, DXF, PDF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, Ruida file support\\n- Vector tracing with multiple algorithms\\n- Image preprocessing (denoising, invert, threshold)\\n\\n**Machine Control**\\n\\n- Multi-machine profiles\\n- Firmware settings for GRBL, Smoothieware, Marlin\\n- G-code macros and hooks\\n- Variable substitution\\n- Terminal console with live status\\n\\n**Visualization**\\n\\n- 3D G-code preview with full simulation\\n- Camera alignment\\n- Dark and light themes\\n- Multi-language support\\n\\n## A Look Back\\n\\nThe first commit was made on February 1st, 2025, at 19:37:27.

Here\\nare five tips to help you get the most out of Rayforge.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## 1. Use Overscan for Smoother Raster Engraving\\n\\nWhen doing raster engraving, one common issue is visible lines or\\ninconsistencies at the edges where the laser changes direction. This\\nhappens because the laser head needs to decelerate and accelerate, which\\ncan affect engraving quality.\\n\\n**Solution**: Enable **Overscan** in your raster operation settings.\\n\\nOverscan extends the laser\'s travel path beyond the actual engraving\\narea, allowing the head to reach full speed before entering the work\\narea and maintain that speed throughout. This results in much smoother,\\nmore consistent engraving.\\n\\nTo enable overscan:\\n\\n1. Select your raster operation\\n2. Open the operation settings\\n3. Enable \\"Overscan\\" and set the distance (typically 3-5mm works well)\\n\\nLearn more in our [Overscan guide](/docs/features/overscan).\\n\\n## 2. Optimize Travel Time with Path Ordering\\n\\nFor contour operations with many separate paths, the order in which the\\nlaser visits each shape can significantly impact total job time.\\n\\n**Solution**: Use Rayforge\'s built-in **travel time optimization**.\\n\\nRayforge can automatically reorder paths to minimize non-cutting travel\\ntime. This is especially useful for jobs with many small objects or text\\nwith multiple letters.\\n\\nThe path optimization is typically enabled by default, but you can\\nverify and adjust it in the Contour operation settings.\\n\\n## 3. Add Holding Tabs to Prevent Part Movement\\n\\nNothing is more frustrating than having a nearly-finished cut job ruined\\nbecause the part shifted or fell through the machine bed at the last\\nmoment.\\n\\n**Solution**: Use **Holding Tabs** to keep parts in place until the job\\nis complete.\\n\\nHolding tabs are small uncut sections that keep your part connected to\\nthe surrounding material. After the job completes, you can easily remove\\nthe part and clean up the tabs with a knife or sandpaper.\\n\\nRayforge supports both manual and automatic tab placement:\\n\\n- **Manual**: Click exactly where you want tabs in the canvas\\n- **Automatic**: Specify the number of tabs and let Rayforge distribute\\n  them evenly\\n\\nCheck out the [Holding Tabs documentation](/docs/features/holding-tabs)\\nfor a complete guide.\\n\\n## 4. Preview Your Job in 3D Before Running\\n\\nOne of Rayforge\'s most valuable features is the 3D G-code preview. It\'s\\ntempting to skip this step and send the job directly to the machine, but\\ntaking a moment to preview can save you time and materials.\\n\\n**What to look for in the preview**:\\n\\n- Verify all operations are executing in the correct order\\n- Check for any unexpected toolpaths or overlaps\\n- Confirm that multi-pass operations have the correct number of passes\\n- Ensure the job bounds fit within your material\\n\\nTo open the 3D preview, click the **3D Preview** button in the main\\ntoolbar after generating your G-code.\\n\\nLearn more about the 3D preview in our\\n[UI documentation](/docs/ui/3d-preview).\\n\\n## 5. Use Custom G-code Hooks for Consistent Workflows\\n\\nIf you find yourself running the same G-code commands before or after\\nevery job\u2014like homing, turning on an air assist, or running a focus\\nroutine\u2014you can automate this with **G-code Macros & Hooks**.\\n\\n**Common use cases**:\\n\\n- **Pre-job hook**: Home the machine, turn on air assist, run an\\n  auto-focus routine\\n- **Post-job hook**: Turn off air assist, return to home position, play\\n  a completion sound\\n- **Layer-specific macros**: Change focus height between operations,\\n  switch laser modules\\n\\nHooks support variable substitution, so you can reference job properties\\nlike material thickness, operation type, and more.\\n\\nExample pre-job hook:\\n\\n```gcode\\nG28 ; Home all axes\\nM8 ; Turn on air assist\\nG0 Z{focus_height} ; Move to focus height\\n```\\n\\nSee our [G-code Macros & Hooks guide](/docs/machine/hooks-macros) for\\ndetailed examples and variable reference.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Bonus Tip: Test on Scrap Material First\\n\\nWhile this isn\'t specific to Rayforge, it\'s worth repeating: always test\\nnew settings, operations, or materials on scrap first. Use Rayforge\'s\\nmaterial profiles and operation presets to save your tested settings for\\nfuture use.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Have your own Rayforge tips and tricks?

This happens because the laser head needs to decelerate and accelerate, which can affect engraving quality.</p> <p>Solution: Enable Overscan in your raster operation settings.</p> <p>Overscan extends the laser's travel path beyond the actual engraving area, allowing the head to reach full speed before entering the work area and maintain that speed throughout. This results in much smoother, more consistent engraving.</p> <p>To enable overscan:</p> <ol> <li>Select your raster operation</li> <li>Open the operation settings</li> <li>Enable \"Overscan\" and set the distance (typically 3-5mm works well)</li> </ol> <p>Learn more in our Overscan guide.</p>","tags":["engraving","optimization","quality","workflow"]},{"location":"blog/2025/02/20/5-tips-for-better-laser-engraving-results-with-rayforge.html#2-optimize-travel-time-with-path-ordering","title":"2.

A single abstract base class, <code>DocItem</code>, defines the common interface for all objects that can exist in the document tree (e.g., layers, workpieces, groups). This allows complex, nested structures to be treated uniformly.</p> <p>Key principles of the model include:</p> <ul> <li>Tree Structure: The <code>Doc</code> object serves as the root of the tree. Each   item (except the root) has a single <code>parent</code> and can have multiple   <code>children</code>.</li> <li>Reactivity: The model uses a signal/slot system (<code>blinker</code>). When an   item is changed, it emits a signal. Parent items listen to their   children's signals and \"bubble them up\" the tree. This allows   high-level components like the <code>Pipeline</code> to listen for any   change in the document by connecting to a single signal on the root   <code>Doc</code> object. The system tracks both content changes and transform   changes separately for efficient updates.</li> <li>Transformation Hierarchy: Every <code>DocItem</code> has a local transformation   <code>Matrix</code>. An item's final position, scale, and rotation in the \"world\"   (the main canvas) is the product of its own local matrix and the   world matrices of all its ancestors.</li> <li>Data Decoupling: The visual or raw data for a <code>WorkPiece</code> is not   stored directly within it. Instead, the <code>WorkPiece</code> holds a UID that   references an <code>ImportSource</code> object in a central registry on the <code>Doc</code>.   This decouples the document structure from the data management,   making the model more lightweight and flexible.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"docs/latest/developer/docmodel.html#class-inheritance","title":"Class Inheritance","text":"<p>This diagram shows the class hierarchy.
